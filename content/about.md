# STUTZ - Räppli in Blöckli
STUTZ is a community-driven fun cryptocurrency that aims to be widespread in Switzerland. We are a nonprofit and fun-first project that evolved from a Telegram group about Altcoins. A group of enthusiasts formed a core team with developers, community marketers and advisors. In the good helvetic spirit we try to stay as far away from hierarchy as we can and as community-driven as possible.

## A Brief History of STUTZ
Founded in late 2017 by Swiss Altcoiners, created a dedicated group and started spreading the word. The community began to actively involve itself and the first community vote was taken (blockchain platform). In good Swiss spirit the first vote was overruled and we ultimately decided to build STUTZ on NEM. Social media accounts, domains and coworking spaces were set up and a core team formed.
Within a few weeks we ran a community contest to create a logo and then took a vote on which one should be used for STUTZ. Many great ideas were in the vote.
Since that the core team is developing, writing, brainstorming and setting up the future of STUTZ while the community spreads the word. From “Bastelbogen” (legendary STUTZ-pyramid, even had appearances at the CFC 2018) to 3D prints, sticker sets, and early STUTZ Swag - the community is active! Last but not least we should mention the very strong meme support; if STZ was listed on an exchange today, moon would be almost guaranteed by now.
